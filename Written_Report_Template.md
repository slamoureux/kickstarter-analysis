## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1) Most successful campaigns were launched in the spring and summer (April - August).
2) The worst time to launch a campaign is the last third of the year (September - August).

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1) Projects with a goal of less than $5000 are the most likely to be successful.
2) We highly suggest to not set your goal at or above $45000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

Our data does not tell us anything about the people behind the projects. Differences in a campaign being successful or not could be due to the experience of the individuals running it and how well known they are. This data also is only concerned with the country the campaigns are in when there can be big differences based on the city where they are started. For example, a project started in New York City, which has a big theater population is more likely to succeed than one in Anchorage or Omaha.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Additionally we could create a graph showing the number of backers a project had versus whether the project was successful or not and compare that with the chart showing the outcome of a project based on its goal. It could give you an idea of how many people you'd want to reach and what is an appropriate amount to ask for. We could also look at how long successful campaigns fundraised for. It could give you a chance to plan out your campaign better and what to expect as it progress so you don't get too discourage when funding slows.
